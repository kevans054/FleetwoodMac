                History of the Band!

            <p>Fleetwood Mac are a British-American rock band, formed in London in 1967. Fleetwood
            Mac were founded by guitarist Peter Green, drummer Mick Fleetwood and guitarist Jeremy
            Spencer, before bassist John McVie joined the lineup for their self-titled debut
            album. Danny Kirwan joined as a third guitarist in 1968. Keyboardist Christine
             Perfect, who contributed as a session musician from the second album, married
              McVie and joined in 1970.
            </p>

            <p>Primarily a British blues band, Fleetwood Mac scored a UK number one 
            with "Albatross",[6] and had other hits such as the singles "Oh Well"
            and "Man of the World". All three guitarists left in succession during
            the early 1970s, to be replaced by guitarists Bob Welch and Bob Weston
            and vocalist Dave Walker. By 1974, all three of them had either departed
            or been dismissed, leaving the band without a male lead vocalist or guitarist.
            In late 1974, while Fleetwood was scouting studios in Los Angeles, he was
            introduced to American folk-rock duo Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks.
            Fleetwood Mac soon asked Buckingham to be their new lead guitarist, and 
            Buckingham agreed on condition that Nicks would also join the band.
            </p>

            <p> The addition of Buckingham and Nicks gave the band a more pop rock sound,
            and their 1975 self-titled album, Fleetwood Mac, reached No. 1 in the United
            States. Rumours (1977), Fleetwood Mac's second album after the arrival of
            Buckingham and Nicks, produced four U.S. Top 10 singles and remained at number
            one on the American albums chart for 31 weeks. It also reached the top spot in
            various countries around the world and won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year
            in 1978. Rumours has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it the one of
            the best-selling albums in history. The band went through personal turmoil while
            recording the album, as both the romantic partnerships in the band 
            (one being John and Christine McVie, and the other being Buckingham and Nicks) 
            separated while continuing to make music together.
            </p>

            <p>The band's personnel remained stable through three more studio albums, 
            but by the late 1980s began to disintegrate. After Buckingham and Nicks
            each left the band, they were replaced by a number of other guitarists
            and vocalists. A 1993 one-off performance for the first inauguration 
            of Bill Clinton featured the lineup of Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine 
            McVie, Nicks, and Buckingham back together for the first time in six years. A full reunion occurred four years later, and the group released their fourth U.S. No. 1 album, The Dance (1997), a live compilation of their hits, also marking the 20th anniversary of Rumours. Christine McVie left the band in 1998, but continued to work with the band in a session capacity. Meanwhile, the group remained together as a four-piece, releasing their most recent studio album, Say You Will, in 2003. Christine McVie rejoined the band full-time in 2014. In 2018, Buckingham was fired from the band[7] and was replaced by Mike Campbell, formerly of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and Neil Finn of Split Enz and Crowded House.

            <p>Fleetwood Mac have sold more than 120 million records worldwide, making
                them one of the world's best-selling bands. In 1979, the group were honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1998 the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame[8] and received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.[9]

                It's the only Fleetwood Mac song credited to all five members of their 1977 lineup.

"'The Chain' basically came out of a jam. That song was put together as distinct from someone literally sitting down and writing a song. It was very much collectively a band composition. The riff is John McVie's contribution - a major contribution. Because that bassline is still being played on British TV in the car-racing series to this day. The Grand Prix thing. But it was really something that just came out of us playing in the studio," Mick Fleetwood said.
